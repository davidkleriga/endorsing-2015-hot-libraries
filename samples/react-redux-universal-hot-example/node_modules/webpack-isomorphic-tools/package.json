On the server in development mode it needs to be injected automagically through javascript to support hot module reload, so you don't need to know the exact path to it on disk because it isn't even a `.css` file on your disk: it's actually a javascript file because that's how Webpack [style-loader](https://github.com/webpack/style-loader) works. So you don't need to `require()` your styles in the server code because you simply can't because there are no such files. (You only need to require `style.css` in your `client-application.js` which is gonna be a Webpack entry point)\r\n\r\nWhat about fonts? Fonts are parsed correctly by Webpack [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) when it finds `url()` sections in your main `style.css`, so no issues there.\r\n\r\nWhat's left are images. Images are `require()`d in React components and then used like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n// alternatively one can use import, but in this case hot reloading won't work\r\n// import image from '../image.png'\r\n\r\n// next you just `src` your image inside your `render()` method\r\nclass Photo extends React.Component\r\n{\r\n  render()\r\n  {\r\n    // when Webpack url-loader finds this `require()` call \r\n    // it will copy `image.png` to your build folder \r\n    // and name it something like `9059f094ddb49c2b0fa6a254a6ebf2ad.png`, \r\n    // because we are using the `[hash]` file naming feature of Webpack url-loader\r\n    // which (feature) is required to make browser caching work correctly\r\n    const image = require('../image.png')\r\n\r\n    return <img src={image}/>\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt works on the client because Webpack intelligently replaces all the `require()` calls for you.\r\nBut it wouldn't work on the server because Node.js only knows how to `require()` javascript modules.\r\nWhat `webpack-isomorphic-tools` does is it makes the code above work on the server too (and much more), so that you can have your isomorphic (universal) rendering (e.g. React).\r\n\r\nWhat about javascripts on the Html page?\r\n\r\nWhen you render your Html page on the server you need to include all the client scripts using `<script src={...}/>` tags. And for that purpose you need to know the real paths to your Webpack compiled javascripts. Which are gonna have names like `main-9059f094ddb49c2b0fa6a254a6ebf2ad.js` because we are using the `[hash]` file naming feature of Webpack which is required to make browser caching work correctly. And `webpack-isomorphic-tools` tells you these filenames (see the [Usage](#usage) section). \r\n\r\nIt also tells you real paths to your CSS styles in case you're using [extract-text-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/webpack/extract-text-webpack-plugin) which is usually the case for production build.\r\n\r\nAside all of that, `webpack-isomorphic-tools` is highly extensible, and finding the real paths for your assets is just the simplest example of what it's capable of. Using [custom configuration](#configuration) one can make `require()` calls return virtually anything (not just String, it may be a JSON object, for example). For example, if you're using Webpack [css-loader](https://github.com/webpack/css-loader) modules feature (also referred to as [\"local styles\"](https://medium.com/seek-ui-engineering/the-end-of-global-css-90d2a4a06284)) you can make `require(*.css)` calls return JSON objects with CSS class names like they do in [react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example#styles) (it's just a demonstration of what one can do with `webpack-isomorphic-tools`, and I'm not using this \"modules\" feature of `ccs-plugin` in my projects).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ npm install webpack-isomorphic-tools --save\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nFirst you add `webpack_isomorphic_tools` plugin to your Webpack configuration.\r\n\r\n### webpack.config.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin = require('webpack-isomorphic-tools/plugin')\r\n\r\nvar webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin = \r\n  // webpack-isomorphic-tools settings reside in a separate .js file \r\n  // (because they will be used in the web server code too).\r\n  new Webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin(require('./webpack-isomorphic-tools-configuration'))\r\n  // also enter development mode since it's a development webpack configuration\r\n  // (see below for explanation)\r\n  .development()\r\n\r\n// usual Webpack configuration\r\nmodule.exports =\r\n{\r\n  context: '(required) your project path here',\r\n\r\n  output:\r\n  {\r\n    publicPath: '(required) web path for static files here'\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  module:\r\n  {\r\n    loaders:\r\n    [\r\n      ...,\r\n      {\r\n        test: webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin.regular_expression('images'),\r\n        loader: 'url-loader?limit=10240', // any image below or equal to 10K will be converted to inline base64 instead\r\n      }\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  plugins:\r\n  [\r\n    ...,\r\n\r\n    webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin\r\n  ]\r\n\r\n  ...\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhat does `.development()` method do? It enables development mode. In short, when in development mode, it disables asset caching (and enables asset hot reload). Just call it if you're developing your project with `webpack-dev-server` using this config (and don't call it for production webpack build).\r\n\r\nFor each asset type managed by `webpack_isomorphic_tools` there should be a corresponding loader in your Webpack configuration. For this reason `webpack_isomorphic_tools/plugin` provides a `.regular_expression(asset_type)` method. The `asset_type` parameter is taken from your `webpack-isomorphic-tools` configuration:\r\n\r\n### webpack-isomorphic-tools-configuration.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport Webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin from 'webpack-isomorphic-tools/plugin'\r\n\r\nexport default\r\n{\r\n  assets:\r\n  {\r\n    images:\r\n    {\r\n      extensions: ['png', 'jpg', 'gif', 'ico', 'svg'],\r\n      parser: Webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin.url_loader_parser // see Configuration and API sections for more info on this parameter\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it for the client side. Next, the server side. You create your server side instance of `webpack-isomorphic-tools` in the very main server javascript file (and your web application code will reside in some `server.js` file which is `require()`d in the bottom)\r\n\r\n### main.js\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar Webpack_isomorphic_tools = require('webpack-isomorphic-tools')\r\n\r\n// this must be equal to your Webpack configuration \"context\" parameter\r\nvar project_base_path = require('path').resolve(__dirname, '..')\r\n\r\n// this global variable will be used later in express middleware\r\nglobal.webpack_isomorphic_tools = new Webpack_isomorphic_tools(require('./webpack-isomorphic-tools-configuration'))\r\n// enter development mode if needed \r\n// (for example, based on a Webpack DefinePlugin variable)\r\n.development(_development_)\r\n// initializes a server-side instance of webpack-isomorphic-tools\r\n// (the first parameter is the base path for your project)\r\n.server(project_base_path, function()\r\n{\r\n  // webpack-isomorphic-tools is all set now.\r\n  // here goes all your web application code:\r\n  require('./server')\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen you, for example, create an express middleware to render your pages on the server\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React from 'react'\r\n\r\n// html page markup\r\nimport Html from './html'\r\n\r\n// will be used in express_application.use(...)\r\nexport function page_rendering_middleware(request, response)\r\n{\r\n  // clear require() cache if in development mode\r\n  // (makes asset hot reloading work)\r\n  if (_development_)\r\n  {\r\n    webpack_isomorphic_tools.refresh()\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  // for react-router example of determining current page by URL take a look at this:\r\n  // https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/code/server/webpage%20rendering.js\r\n  const page_component = [determine your page component here using request.path]\r\n\r\n  // for a Redux Flux store implementation you can see the same example:\r\n  // https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/code/server/webpage%20rendering.js\r\n  const flux_store = [initialize and populate your flux store depending on the page being shown]\r\n\r\n  // render the page to string and send it to the browser as text/html\r\n  response.send('<!doctype html>\\n' +\r\n        React.renderToString(<Html assets={webpack_isomorphic_tools.assets()} component={page_component} store={flux_store}/>))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd finally you use the `assets` inside the `Html` component's `render()` method\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport React, {Component, PropTypes} from 'react'\r\nimport serialize from 'serialize-javascript'\r\n\r\nexport default class Html extends Component\r\n{\r\n  static propTypes =\r\n  {\r\n    assets    : PropTypes.object,\r\n    component : PropTypes.object,\r\n    store     : PropTypes.object\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  render()\r\n  {\r\n    const { assets, component, store } = this.props\r\n\r\n    // \"import\" will work here too \r\n    // but if you want hot reloading to work while developing your project\r\n    // then you need to use require()\r\n    // because import will only be executed a single time \r\n    // (when the application launches)\r\n    // you can refer to the \"Require() vs import\" section for more explanation\r\n    const picture = require('../assets/images/cat.jpg')\r\n\r\n    // favicon\r\n    const icon = require('../assets/images/icon/32x32.png')\r\n\r\n    const html = \r\n    (\r\n      <html lang=\"en-us\">\r\n        <head>\r\n          <meta charSet=\"utf-8\"/>\r\n          <title>xHamster</title>\r\n\r\n          {/* favicon */}\r\n          <link rel=\"shortcut icon\" href={icon} />\r\n\r\n          {/* styles (will be present only in production with webpack extract text plugin) */}\r\n          {Object.keys(assets.styles).map((style, i) =>\r\n            <link href={assets.styles[style]} key={i} media=\"screen, projection\"\r\n                  rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\"/>)}\r\n        </head>\r\n\r\n        <body>\r\n          {/* image requiring demonstration */}\r\n          <img src={picture}/>\r\n\r\n          {/* rendered React page */}\r\n          <div id=\"content\" dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: React.renderToString(component)}}/>\r\n\r\n          {/* Flux store data will be reloaded into the store on the client */}\r\n          <script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: `window._flux_store_data=${serialize(store.getState())};`}} />\r\n\r\n          {/* javascripts */}\r\n          {/* (usually one for each \"entry\" in webpack configuration) */}\r\n          {/* (for more informations on \"entries\" see https://github.com/petehunt/webpack-howto/) */}\r\n          {Object.keys(assets.javascript).map((script, i) =>\r\n            <script src={assets.javascript[script]} key={i}/>\r\n          )}\r\n        </body>\r\n      </html>\r\n    )\r\n\r\n    return html\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n`assets` in the code above are simply the contents of `webpack-assets.json` which is created by `webpack-isomorphic-tools` in your project base folder. `webpack-assets.json` (in the simplest case) keeps track of the real paths to your assets, e.g.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  javascript:\r\n  {\r\n    main: '/assets/main-d8c29e9b2a4623f696e8.js'\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  styles:\r\n  {\r\n    main: '/assets/main-d8c29e9b2a4623f696e8.css'\r\n  },\r\n\r\n  images:\r\n  {\r\n    './assets/images/cat.jpg': '/assets/9059f094ddb49c2b0fa6a254a6ebf2ad.jpg',\r\n    \r\n    './assets/images/icon/32x32.png':

 }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd that's it, now you can `require()` your assets \"isomorphically\" (both on client and server).\r\n\r\n## A working example\r\n\r\n`webpack-isomorphic-tools` are featured in [react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example).\r\n\r\nAlso for a comprehensive example of isomorphic React rendering you can look at this sample project:\r\n\r\n* clone [this repo](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema)\r\n* `npm install`\r\n* `npm run dev`\r\n* wait a moment for Webpack to finish the first build (green stats will appear in the terminal)\r\n* go to `http://localhost:3000`\r\n* `Ctrl + C`\r\n* `npm run production`\r\n* go to `http://localhost:3000`\r\n\r\nSome source code guidance for this particular project:\r\n\r\n* [webpack-isomorphic-tools configuration](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/webpack/isomorphic.js)\r\n* [webpack-isomorphic-tools client initialization](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/webpack/development%20server.js)\r\n* [webpack-isomorphic-tools server initialization](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/code/server/entry.js)\r\n* [webpage rendering express middleware](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/code/server/webpage%20rendering.js)\r\n* [the Html file](https://github.com/halt-hammerzeit/cinema/blob/master/code/client/html.js)\r\n\r\n## Configuration\r\n\r\nAvailable configuration parameters:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\n{\r\n  // sets \"development\" mode flag.\r\n  // see the API section below for method .development()\r\n  // for more explanation about what \"development\" mode does\r\n  // and when is it needed.\r\n

.development(true or false or undefined -> true)\r\n\r\n(both Webpack plugin and server tools)\r\n\r\nIs it development mode or is it production mode? By default it's production mode. But if you're instantiating `webpack-isomorphic-tools/plugin` for use in Webpack development configuration, or if you're instantiating `webpack-isomorphic-tools` on server when you're developing your project, then you should call this method to enable asset hot reloading (and disable asset caching). It should be called right after the constructor.\r\n\r\n#### .regular_expression(asset_type)\r\n\r\n(Webpack plugin)\r\n\r\nReturns the regular expression for this asset type (based on this asset type's `extension` (or `extensions`))\r\n\r\n#### Webpack_isomorphic_tools_plugin.url_loader_parser\r\n\r\n(Webpack plugin)\r\n\r\nA parser (see [Configuration](#configuration) section above) for Webpack [url-loader](https://github.com/webpack/url-loader), also works for Webpack [file-loader](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader). Use it for your images, fonts, etc.\r\n\r\n#### .server(project_path, callback)\r\n\r\n(server tools)\r\n\r\nInitializes a server-side instance of `webpack-isomorphic-tools` with the base path for your project and makes all the server-side `require()` calls work. The `project_path` parameter must be identical to the `context` parameter of your Webpack configuration and is needed to locate `webpack-assets.json` (contains the assets info) which is output by Webpack process. The callback is called when `webpack-assets.json` has been found (it's needed for development because `webpack-dev-server` and your application server are usually run in parallel).\r\n\r\n#### .refresh()\r\n\r\n(server tools)\r\n\r\nRefreshes your assets info (re-reads `webpack-assets.json` from disk) and also flushes cache for all the previously `require()`d assets\r\n\r\n#### .assets()\r\n\r\n(server tools)\r\n\r\nReturns the contents of `webpack-assets.json` which is created by `webpack-isomorphic-tools` in your project base folder\r\n\r\n## Gotchas\r\n\r\n### .gitignore\r\n\r\nMake sure you add this to your `.gitignore`\r\n\r\n```\r\n# webpack-isomorphic-tools\r\n/webpack-stats.debug.json\r\n/webpack-assets.json\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Require() vs import\r\n\r\nIn the image requiring examples above we could have wrote it like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport picture from './cat.jpg'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat would surely work. Much simpler and more modern. But, the disadvantage of the new ES6 module `import`ing is that by design it's static as opposed to dynamic nature of `require()`. Such a design decision was done on purpose and it's surely the right one:\r\n\r\n* it's static so it can be optimized by the compiler and you don't need to know which module depends on which and manually reorder them in the right order because the compiler does it for you\r\n* it's smart enough to resolve cyclic dependencies\r\n* it can load modules both synchronously and asynchronously if it wants to and you'll never know because it can do it all by itself behind the scenes without your supervision\r\n* the `export`s are static which means that your IDE can know exactly what each module is gonna export without compiling the code (and therefore it can autocomplete names, detect syntax errors, check types, etc); the compiler too has some benefits such as improved lookup speed and syntax and type checking\r\n* it's simple, it's transparent, it's sane\r\n\r\nIf you wrote your code with just `import`s it would work fine. But imagine you're developing your website, so you're changing files constantly, and you would like it all refresh automagically when you reload your webpage (in development mode). `webpack-isomorphic-tools` gives you that. Remember this code in the express middleware example above?\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nif (_development_)\r\n{\r\n  webpack_isomorhic_tools.refresh()\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt does exactly as it says: it refreshes everything on page reload when you're in development mode. And to leverage this feature you need to use dynamic module loading as opposed to static one through `import`s. This can be done by `require()`ing your assets, and not at the top of the file where all `require()`s usually go but, say, inside the `reder()` method for React components.\r\n\r\nI also read on the internets that ES6 supports dynamic module loading too and it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nSystem.import('some_module')\r\n.then(some_module =>\r\n{\r\n  // Use some_module\r\n})\r\n.catch(error =>\r\n{\r\n  ...\r\n})\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm currently unfamiliar with ES6 dynamic module loading system because I didn't research this question. Anyway it's still a draft specification so I guess good old `require()` is just fine to the time being.\r\n\r\nAlso it's good to know that the way all this `require('./asset.whatever_extension')` magic is based on [Node.js require hooks](http://bahmutov.calepin.co/hooking-into-node-loader-for-fun-and-profit.html) and it works with `import`s only when your ES6 code is transpiled by Babel which simply replaces all the `import`s with `require()`s. For now, everyone out there uses Babel, both on client and server. But when the time comes for ES6 to be widely natively adopted, and when a good enough ES6 module loading specification is released, then I (or someone else) will step in and port this \"require hook\" to ES6 to work with `import`s.\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\nInitially based on the code from [react-redux-universal-hot-example](https://github.com/erikras/react-redux-universal-hot-example) by Erik Rasmussen\r\n\r\nAlso the same codebase (as in the project mentioned above) can be found in [isomorphic500](https://github.com/gpbl/isomorphic500) by Giampaolo Bellavite\r\n\r\nAlso uses `require()` hooking techniques from [node-hook](https://github.com/bahmutov/node-hook) by Gleb Bahmutov\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\n\r\nAfter cloning this repo, ensure dependencies are installed by running:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis module is written in ES6 and uses [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) for ES5\r\ntranspilation. Widely consumable JavaScript can be produced by running:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm run build\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce `npm run build` has run, you may `import` or `require()` directly from\r\nnode.\r\n\r\nAfter developing, the full test suite can be evaluated by running:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile actively developing, one can use\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nnpm run watch\r\n```\r\n\r\nin a terminal. This will watch the file system and run tests automatically \r\nwhenever you save a js file.\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n[MIT](LICENSE)\r\n[npm-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webpack-isomorphic-tools.svg\r\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/webpack-isomorphic-tools\r\n[travis-image]: https://img.shields.io/travis/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools/master.svg\r\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools\r\n[downloads-image]: https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/webpack-isomorphic-tools.svg\r\n[downloads-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/webpack-isomorphic-tools\r\n[coveralls-image]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools/master.svg\r\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/halt-hammerzeit/webpack-isomorphic-tools?branch=master\r\n\r\n<!---\r\n[gratipay-image]: https://img.shields.io/gratipay/dougwilson.svg\r\n[gratipay-url]: https://gratipay.com/dougwilson/\r\n-->",
